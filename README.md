# RuleQuirks

**Unique, unconventional Detekt rules, expanding linting beyond the norm. Perfect for ous.**

## Documentation

You can find the documentation about how to write [custom rules here][custom_rule_documentation].

## Note

- Remember that, by default, all rules are disabled. To configure your rules edit the file in
`src/main/resources/config/config.yml`.
- Once you have your rules ready you can publish them on the [detekt's marketplace][detekt_marketplace] to improve the discoverability. To do so create a PR editing [this file][detekt_marketplace_edit].
